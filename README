The imaginatively-titled "HTPC frontend"

Provides a nice overview page for an HTPC running XBMC.
Here's a screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/pfUjy.jpg

It currently has the following features:

* Customisable 'applications' widget providing quick access to web interfaces (e.g. SABnzb+).

* 'Recently added episodes' widget with thumbnails - just click to play in XBMC.

* 'Currently playing' widget which appears when something is playing and hides again when
  it is finished.

* SABnzbd+ widget showing basic info about SABnzb+ - what is downloading, at what speed,
  and how long is remaining. Only appears when something is downloading, and hides again
  when it is done.

Uses Flask. Just set up htpcfrontend.py to be served using Apache and mod_wsgi or something.

This is an early-stage work-in-progress. More features coming when I find a use for them!
