Maraschino
A frontend for XBMC HTPCs



What is Maraschino?
-------------------

I wanted a simple web interface to act as a nice overview/front page for my XBMC HTPC. I couldn't
find anything that suited my requirements so I created something myself.

You can find some fancy screenshots and setup instructions on the project homepage:

What features does it have?
---------------------------

* Customisable applications widget providing quick access to your web interfaces (e.g. SABnzb+,
  SickBeard, or whatever else you want to link to)

* Recently added episodes widget - click an episode to play it in XBMC

* Media library browser - browse your movies and TV shows, and click to play in XBMC

* SABnzbd+ widget which appears when something is downloading and hides again when finished -
  shows you what is currently downloading, speed, time/MB remaining, and a progress bar

* Currently playing bar with play/pause/stop controls

* trakt.tv widget which shows you what people are saying about the episode or movie that you're
  watching (requires a free trakt.tv account)

* Full-screen background image changes to the fanart of what you're currently watching (optional,
  can be turned off)

* Customisable via a server-side settings file - choose which modules to display, in which
  column/order you would like them displayed, and how frequently each one should update

Uses Flask. Just set up htpcfrontend.py to be served using Apache and mod_wsgi or however
your prefer to do it.

This is an early-stage work-in-progress - if you run into any problems then let me know,
perhaps I can help (at the very least, bug reports are always welcome!)



Why is it called Maraschino?
----------------------------

If your HTPC is an ice cream sundae then Maraschino is the cherry on top.
