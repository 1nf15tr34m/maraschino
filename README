The imaginatively-titled "HTPC frontend"

Provides a nice overview page for an HTPC running XBMC.
Currently has the following features:

* Customisable 'applications' widget providing quick access to web interfaces (e.g. SABnzb+)
* 'Recently added episodes' widget with thumbnails - just click to play in XBMC
* 'Currently playing' widget which appears when something is playing and hides again when
  it is finished

Uses Flask. Just set it up to be served using Apache or something.

This is an early-stage work-in-progress. More features coming when I find a use for them!
