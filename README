The imaginatively-titled "HTPC frontend"

Provides a nice overview page for an HTPC running XBMC. Requires Eden-pre (not Dharma) as
there are some pretty gnarly API changes in the new version.

Here are a couple of screenshots:

It currently has the following features:

* Customisable 'applications' widget providing quick access to web interfaces (e.g.
  SABnzb+, SickBeard, or whatever you want to link to)

* 'Recently added episodes' widget with thumbnails - also, you can just click the episode
  and it will play in XBMC

* SABnzbd+ widget which appears when something is downloading and hides again when finished.
  Currently just gives you basic info (currently downloading, speed, time/MB remaining).

* 'Currently playing' bar which appears when something is playing and hides again when it is
  finished, a lot like AWX's

* trakt.tv widget which shows you what people are saying about the episode or movie that
  you're watching (requires a free trakt.tv account)

* Full-screen background image changes to trakt's fanart of what you're currently watching
  (optional, can be turned off)

* Customisable via a server-side settings file - choose which modules to display, in which
  column/order you would like them displayed, and how frequently each one should update

Uses Flask. Just set up htpcfrontend.py to be served using Apache and mod_wsgi or however
your prefer to do it. Here are some basic setup instructions (until I create some proper
documentation):

This is an early-stage work-in-progress - if you run into any problems then let me know,
perhaps I can help (at the very least, bug reports are always welcome!)
