      <h2>What is HTPC Frontend?</h2>
      <p>I wanted a simple web interface to act as a nice overview/front page for my XBMC HTPC. I couldn't find anything that suited my requirements so I created something myself.</p>
      <p>Here are some of its features:</p>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>Customisable 'applications' widget providing quick access to your web interfaces (e.g. SABnzb+, SickBeard, or whatever else you want to link to)</li>
        <li>'Recently added episodes' widget - you can click the episode and it will play in XBMC</li>
        <li>Media library browser - browse your movies and TV shows, and click to play in XBMC</li>
        <li>SABnzbd+ widget which appears when something is downloading and hides again when finished - shows you what is currently downloading, speed, time/MB remaining, progress bar</li>
        <li>'Currently playing' bar with play/pause/stop controls</li>
        <li>trakt.tv widget which shows you what people are saying about the episode or movie that you're watching (requires a free trakt.tv account)</li>
        <li>Full-screen background image changes to the fanart of what you're currently watching (optional, can be turned off)</li>
        <li>Customisable via a server-side settings file - choose which modules to display, in which column/order you would like them displayed, and how frequently each one should update</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="screenshots clearfix">
        <a href="static/images/screenshot1.jpg"><img src="static/images/screenshot1_thumb.jpg" width="440" height="262" alt="Screenshot 1"></a>
        <a href="static/images/screenshot2.jpg"><img src="static/images/screenshot2_thumb.jpg" width="440" height="262" alt="Screenshot 2"></a>
      </div>

      <p>It is a work-in-progress - things are still being changed, and new features and modules are being added quite frequently.</p>

      <h2>Awesome. How do I use it?</h2>

      <p>HTPC Frontend is written in Python and uses the Flask framework, so you need to configure a suitable web server (such as Apache) to serve it.</p>
      <p>If you want to use Apache and mod_wsgi on a Linux-based system then you could do the following:</p>

      <ol class="numbers instructions">

        <li>
          <strong>Install the following:</strong>
          <ul class="bullets">
            <li>Apache</li>
            <li>mod_wsgi</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>
              python-setuptools, so that you can use easy_install for the following:
              <ul class="bullets">
                <li>Flask (easy_install Flask)</li>
                <li>jsonrpclib (easy_install jsonrpclib)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Clone the htpc-frontend repository.</strong> You can find it on github:
          <a href="https://github.com/mrkipling/htpc-frontend">https://github.com/mrkipling/htpc-frontend</a>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Create a settings file.</strong>
          Copy settings_example.py to settings.py - you will learn about customising it later.
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Serve htpcfrontend.py using Apache and mod_wsgi.</strong></p>
          <p>Here's a helpful article: <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/deploying/mod_wsgi/">http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/deploying/mod_wsgi/</a></p>
          <p>Don't forget to add the htpc-frontend directory to your Python path. One way of doing this is in the mod_wsgi file:</p>
          <code>import sys
sys.path.insert(0, "/var/www/htpc-frontend")
from htpcfrontend import app as application</code>
        </li>

      </ol>
