      <h2>What is HTPC Frontend?</h2>
      <p>I wanted a simple web interface to act as a nice overview/front page for my XBMC HTPC. I couldn't find anything that suited my requirements so I created something myself.</p>
      <p>Here are some of its features:</p>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>Customisable 'applications' widget providing quick access to your web interfaces (e.g. SABnzb+, SickBeard, or whatever else you want to link to)</li>
        <li>'Recently added episodes' widget - you can click the episode and it will play in XBMC</li>
        <li>Media library browser - browse your movies and TV shows, and click to play in XBMC</li>
        <li>SABnzbd+ widget which appears when something is downloading and hides again when finished - shows you what is currently downloading, speed, time/MB remaining, progress bar</li>
        <li>'Currently playing' bar with play/pause/stop controls</li>
        <li>trakt.tv widget which shows you what people are saying about the episode or movie that you're watching (requires a free trakt.tv account)</li>
        <li>Full-screen background image changes to the fanart of what you're currently watching (optional, can be turned off)</li>
        <li>Customisable via a server-side settings file - choose which modules to display, in which column/order you would like them displayed, and how frequently each one should update</li>
      </ul>
